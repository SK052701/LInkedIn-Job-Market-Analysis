# LinkedIn-Job-Market-Analysis

## Overview
This project is aimed at pattern exploration and prediction of the job marketplace on LinkedIn using various python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow,...) and machine learning methods (linear regression, random forest, neural net, ...).

The data analysis is based on a dataset from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adampq/linkedin-jobs-machine-learning-data-set ).
